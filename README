Presentation
------------

Just like sed is a stream editor, ted is a token list editor.  Actually, it is
not as powerfull as sed, but its main feature is that it really works with
tokens, not only characters.

The ted package provides two user macros: \Substitute and \ShowTokens. The first
one is maybe the most useful: it performs substitutions in token lists (even
inside braces). The second displays each token of the list (one per line) with
its catcode (in the list, not just the current one), and can be useful for
debugging or for TeX learners.

The ted package is designed to work well even if strange tokens (that is,
unusual (charcode, catcode) pairs or tokens with a confusing meaning) occur in
the list.
